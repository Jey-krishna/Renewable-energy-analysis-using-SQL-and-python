## Introduction
data analysis project focusing on renewable energy systems. The dataset used in this project includes information such as the type of renewable energy source, installed capacity, energy production and consumption, funding sources, environmental impact metrics, and more.
## overview
This  project  is about the  analysis of the renewable energy using python  to Extract, Transform and Load the dataset once all the necessary cleaning works are done into a MYSQl database then next to analyse by wirting differct queries

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

* Type_of_Renewable_Energy: Numerical code representing the type of renewable energy source.
* Installed_Capacity_MW: Installed capacity in megawatts (MW).
* Energy_Production_MWh: Yearly energy production in megawatt-hours (MWh).
* Energy_Consumption_MWh: Yearly energy consumption in megawatt-hours (MWh).
* Energy_Storage_Capacity_MWh: Energy storage capacity in megawatt-hours (MWh).
* Storage_Efficiency_Percentage: Efficiency of energy storage systems in percentage.
* Grid_Integration_Level: Numerical code representing the level of grid integration.
* Initial_Investment_USD: Initial investment costs in USD.
* Funding_Sources: Numerical code representing the funding source.
* Financial_Incentives_USD: Financial incentives in USD.
* GHG_Emission_Reduction_tCO2e: Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e).
* Air_Pollution_Reduction_Index: Air pollution reduction index.
* Jobs_Created: Number of jobs created.

## ETL analysis  using python

* **Step 1 :** using Kaggle agi to extract the data using python.
* **Step 2:** with the help of pandas transform the data like changing the values names, hadling the inconsistent data etc.
* **Step 3:** last to load the dataset into MYSQL server

## Data Analysis using SQL
1. which type of renewable energy has the highest  capacity
2. which founding sources have created the most number of jobs
3. which energy type produces highest energy
4. which type  of energy have highest consumption_ratio
5. hich founding sources have more renewable energy installed
6. Distribution of founding sources and type of nenewable energy vs number of installed
7.  which type of energy have highest investment and incentives
8.  distribution of average GHG emissin and air pollution index
9.  types of energy and its efficiency
